to_be_classified,"A meditative film dealing with Seon Buddhist views on life  Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East? follows the lives of three Buddhist monks: a child  an adult  and an old man.[5]This film is largely about two Zen koans. The koans are: What is my original face before my mother and father were conceived?  and (In death ) where does the master of my being go?The film's title  although not explained literally in the film  is a reference to Bodhidharma  a 6th-century Buddhist monk from India who transmitted Zen to China. The question  Why has Bodhi-Dharma left for the east  is echoed by the young boy's question  Why have we all left the world? The entire film can be seen as an answering of that question  so that the film itself becomes a koan.The three main protagonists are Haejin  an orphan boy  Kibong  a young monk  and Hyegok  a Zen master.Haejin injures a bird while bathing. Its mate does not leave the bird  but stays around  as if to see what becomes of its mate. Heijin takes the injured bird away to heal it  but it dies later in the film.The movie then cuts to a scene in which an ox breaks through a confining fence and escapes to the forest. The ox represents Kibong's need to escape  as well as his own blind passions. The ox  like the young man  escapes its confinement but isn't truly free. It seems free  but really is still subject to its own desires. The young man also escapes the confinement of the world  but is still plagued by his own blind passions. The ox can also be seen as representing the blind passions of the young boy  escaping the walls of his humanity and running amok.The abbot instructs a young monk (Kibong) to assist a Zen master living alone in the mountains. The young monk has renounced his life of hardship in search of peace and perfection.The Zen master is a recluse  living in a monastery on a high mountain  and has come to realise the vanity of knowledge. He also knows the secret of everlasting peace. Dogged by chilblains (inflammation of the hands and feet caused by exposure to cold and moisture)  he tries to lead others to the same realisation  a realisation which comes only with ardent devotion  not simply through knowledge or worship.The old Master mainly tries to communicate his Way through the use of koans - Zen riddles with no absolute answers. The first koan is: What is my original face before my father and mother were conceived? The second koan is  When the moon takes over in your heart (that is  in enlightenment or in death)  where does the master of my being go? He instructs the young monk to hold the koan between his teeth and to solve them. In solving the koans  the old Master tells the young monk that he will find an unshakeable peace.The young monk takes leave of the old monk and goes to town  where he buys medicine for the old man with alms from begging. He also visits his blind mother  who is having a hard time tending to herself. The young monk returns to the monastery  disillusioned and appalled at his own selfishness in renouncing his destiny  which was to serve his mother and family.He returns to the old monk and communicates his desire to go back to life  to embrace the filth of humanity and face the turmoil of day-to-day existence in the swarm of people. He is severely reprimanded by the monk  who  however  does not prevent him. The young monk leaves the monastery to return to his old life  but is caught in a flash flood and nearly drowned. He is found sitting on a rock in the middle of rapids by Haejin. The young monk is then rescued by his Master.When the young monk regains consciousness  he is informed by the boy that his Master had been in meditation for quite a while and is severely ill. Kibong realizes that the Master has traded his own life to save him. Deeply moved  he visits the old Master  who extracts a promise from Kibong to perform his last rites as the old man wishes. His wish is for his body to be burned on top of the hill so that he can return to his original place.News of a festivity on the approaching full-moon day reaches Kibong  who wishes to attend it with the boy. Hyegok  apparently feeling better  gives them leave  assuring Kibong that he would manage well by himself. The old man also asks them to bring enough kerosene for him.At the festival  Kibong and Heijin watch the enthralling dance  while it is made known that the dancer is none other than the old monk himself  in another form. In his monastery  he is slowly making preparations himself. On a bright full-moon night  Heijin and Kibong make their way back. On returning to the monastery  the boy smells burnt medicine; they quickly discover that the old man is dead.True to his promise  with the true meaning and meaninglessness of death  possession  desire  and vanity dawning on him every passing instant  Kibong places the dead body in a wooden chest and slowly starts a difficult trek up the hillside. He carries the chest on a firewood pack  presumably the same pack the young monk had used at the beginning of the film to haul firewood to the monastery. The meaning here is  in death  the body is no different from firewood. This idea was stated earlier by the old man when he told the little boy that the boy's extracted tooth is no different from a pebble in the road.By nightfall  the young monk reaches the burial ground. He tries to light the pyre  but there is a light drizzle and he can't get it started. He suddenly remembers his master's words about the kerosene. He goes back to the monastery and collects the kerosene. He then returns to the burial ground and sets fire to the coffin. He spends the night by the side of the burning body  tortured by his feelings and coming to the full realization of death.Looking around the burning body  we see the ox and the young boy. Both seem transfixed by the blaze. Even the blind passions and foolishness of youth are subdued in death.In the morning  after the funeral pyre has burned down  we see the young monk kneeling and sifting his fingers through the ashes. In this scene  the young monk is fully encountering the true realization of death. He seems to be looking for something in the ashes  and finds the last few remaining bones of his former master. Presumably  these few small bones are the master of the old man's being. They are what is left after everything else is burned away. They are death. The young monk collects these bones and grinds them to powder with a stone. He then walks through the forest  scattering the powdered bones over water  earth  trees  and plants.When the young monk scatters the old man's powdered bones  he returns the old man to his original place  as the old man had said must happen. The old man's original place is everywhere  just as his original face is everything. With this realization  the young monk finally solves the koans and attains the unshakeable peace the old man had spoken about. He then returns to the monastery. Seeking out Heijin  he entrusts the boy with the Master's few remaining possessions. He then takes his leave.In the final sequence  we see the boy coming of age. In a play scene  the young boy re-enacts the previous night's event by burning the old man's few personal belongings. The boy has done in miniature what the young monk had done the night before. In this act  the boy remembers the old man's teachings and comes to understand the nature of impermanence. He wakes up the next day and goes to the stream to collect water. As usual the dead bird's companion chirps to distract him (the chirping bird represents the sound of death)  but this time the boy does not even notice it. Understanding impermanence  his education is complete. He enters the Master's room and closes it after him. An old Master has died and a new Master makes his beginning. The bird flies away  liberated. The wandering ox (which had always been shown before in shadow) returns with a man (possibly Kibong)  walking beside him in sunlight. It too has found peace. Rather than having to face the choice between confinement or escape  the blind passions now walk alongside the human. Both the human and the passions find their true place."

to_be_classified,"A demonstration by unilateral nuclear disarmament protesters (Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament) in London is interrupted when one of the protesters is violently killed. British security forces learn that a terrorist group attached to CND has been planning a significant act of terrorism for the near future. The person killed during the protest demonstration was an undercover intelligence officer who had infiltrated the terrorists. The Commanding Officer of the Special Air Service  Colonel Hadley  suggests a new line of inquiry for the investigation.Two foreign officers arrive to train at the SAS's headquarters: Captain Hagen is a member of the US Army Rangers and Captain Freund is a member of the German GSG9. They are taken to the Close Quarter Battle house and witness an SAS room entry assault. Colonel Hadley introduces them to the SAS man playing the hostage  Captain Peter Skellen  and informs them they will be with Skellen's troop  consisting of Baker  Dennis  and Williamson. During an exercise in the Brecon Beacons  Hadley and Major Steele discover Skellen's troop torturing Hagen and Freund. Skellen is dismissed from the Regiment. The torture and dismissal are a ruse to repaint Skellen as a disgraced former SAS operative  and Hagen and Freund as innocent victims in the scheme.Skellen's intelligence contact  Ryan  advises him to meet Frankie Leith and Rod Walker  the two people who lead the People's Lobby  the terrorist group believed to be planning the act of terrorism. Skellen tells his wife that he will be going away for a while on a mission. A foreign man  Malik  arranges with a city banker for the distribution of large sums of money to various left organisations  including the PL. Skellen arranges to meet Leith at a bar frequented by PL members and initiates a romantic relationship with her  to the annoyance of Walker and his cohorts Helga and Mac. Leith takes Skellen to the organisation's offices and introduces him to the group. Leith appreciates Skellen's SAS background  and offers him a job as security consultant to the PL; she also allows him to move in with her. To strengthen Skellen's cover story  Hadley informs Hagen and Freund of Skellen's location; the wronged men attack Skellen at Leith's home and inflict a severe beating. As a result  Leith's few remaining doubts about Skellen vapourise  but Walker and his cronies still are not fully convinced. Helga observes Skellen meeting the same unknown individual (Ryan) in various locations. Their scrutiny intensifies when Walker and his associates witness Skellen's meeting with his wife and daughter. They use photos from their surveillance to convince Leith that Skellen is not all he seems. Walker orders Helga to kill Ryan  cutting Skellen's link to Hadley. Hadley has no choice but to trust Skellen's abilities to uncover the group's plans and escape alive. He orders police protection for Skellen's family.Despite his official advisory capacity  Skellen is denied details about the upcoming PL operation. On the day of the operation  Leith and Walker instruct Helga and Mac to take Skellen's family hostage. Leith uses this to blackmail Skellen into unconditional co-operation.The terrorists and Skellen arrive at the US Embassy in a hijacked coach. Wearing stolen US Air Force uniforms  they gain entry to the secure compound and take hostages of the US Ambassador  US Secretary of State  US Commander-in-Chief of Strategic Air Command  and British Foreign Secretary  along with their wives and the embassy staff. Hadley and his police counterpart  Commander Powell  arrive at the Embassy to receive the demands of the terrorists: unless a US nuclear missile is launched at Holy Loch Naval Base  all the hostages will be killed. Currie questions Leith's motivations  and Leith responds that her ultimate goal is the disarmament of the whole world. This opens a debate about method and political philosophy that only antagonizes the terrorists.Meanwhile  Dennis and three fellow SAS troopers arrive at Skellen's home. They set up in the attached house next door  using sensing devices to covertly observe Helga  Mac  and their captives through the wall.Skellen manages to separate himself from the group by feigning a need for the toilet. He uses a shaving mirror to heliograph floodlights and signal Hadley via Morse code  telling him to attack at 10 a.m. while Skellen creates a diversion. Hadley cannot get permission for an SAS attack because the British Home Secretary insists that Powell resolve the situation through negotiation. As the tension mounts inside the embassy  a mistake by one of the terrorists causes the death of the SAC C-in-C. This enables Powell and Hadley to get the permission for their assault.The SAS operatives in the house adjoining Skellen's remove a large area of the bricks separating the attached houses. Meanwhile  Helga's temper at the Skellen's crying baby escalates into a fight with Skellen's wife. The operatives work fast to attach a charge to the exposed wall  cut the lights and blow the wall so two SAS soldiers can shoot through the gap and kill both Helga and Mac.As the SAS mount an assault on the embassy  the terrorists panic. Skellen overpowers and kills three terrorists. The SAS  deploying from helicopters  force open doors and enter through windows. As they methodically clear the embassy  Skellen kills more terrorists including Walker. Skellen joins with Baker and his troop to search for Leith  as the other troopers bundle the hostages to safety. When Skellen hesitates to kill Leith on sight  Major Steele kills her before she can kill Skellen.The Ambassador thanks the troopers as they leave the embassy. Skellen and his troop apologise to Hagen and Freund  explain the reason for their actions  and make peace. Skellen departs on one of the helicopters with his colleagues.In a government building  Sir Richard  a politician  complains to a colleague about the violent end to the siege.

Beaumont solicits Legendre's supernatural assistance in getting Madeleine to marry him. Legendre states that the only way is to transform Madeleine into a zombie with a potion.

He asks for one final kiss  and gives her a rose with the potion on it. She kisses the flower and puts it into her bouquet. Shortly after the ceremony  the potion takes effect  and Madeleine appears to die. Haunted by Madeleine's death  Neil takes to drink  and sees apparitions of her in every shadow.Legendre and Beaumont enter Madeleine's tomb at night with Legendre's zombie servants  who were all his enemies when they were alive. Hearing the raving Neil approach  they remove Madeleine's casket from the tomb. Finding it empty  Neil seeks assistance from Dr. Bruner  who explains to him about the possible existence of zombies.In Legendre's cliffside castle  Madeleine has been revived as a zombie  and Beaumont listens to her play the piano  her eyes lifeless. He gives her jewelry  but she does not respond. Beaumont now regrets having transformed her into a zombie. He begs Legendre to return her to life  but he refuses  and demonstrates his mental control over her by wordlessly sending her away. After drinking a glass of wine offered by Legendre  Beaumont realizes that it is tainted with the potion  and that he will be turned into a zombie. Legendre tells Beaumont that he has his own plans for Madeleine. Beaumont calls on his butler  Silver  to help him  but Legendre transfixes Silver with his eyes  and the zombie servants take him away to a terrible death.Neil and Bruner seek out an old witch doctor  Pierre (Dan Crimmins)  who tells them that all his people are afraid of the mountains  which they call The Land of the Living Dead  because of the evil man who lives there named Murder.Camping out not far from the foot of Legendre's castle  Neil and Bruner hear the terrible screeches of a vulture. Bruner heads out to the castle  but Neil is too ill to go with him  so Bruner goes alone. Shortly afterwards  Neil has another vision of Madeleine  and follows it to the castle  where Madeleine is attended by human maids who cannot bear to touch the zombie woman  even to brush her hair.Legendre and Beaumont are together in the main room. Because Beaumont is the first man to actually know that he is turning into a zombie  Legendre questions him about his symptoms  but Beaumont cannot speak.After Neil enters the castle  Legendre senses his presence and silently orders Madeleine to kill him  over Beaumont's feeble protest. She approaches the passed-out Neil with a knife  but she hesitates. Legendre increases his telepathic command  and Madeleine raises the knife to strike  but Bruner stops her. She runs away  and Neil wakes up and sees her  calling after her. He follows her to a high place above the Caribbean Sea  and entreats her to recognize him. Legendre watches them  and telepathically calls his zombie servants to kill Neil. Neil shoots at them  but they are uninjured  and keep coming towards him.Just then  Bruner approaches Legendre and knocks him out  breaking his mental control over his zombies. Undirected  they ignore Neil and walk off the cliff. The veil is lifted from Madeleine's eyes so that she recognizes Neil for a moment  but Legendre wakes up  re-establishing his control over the girl  and forces Neil and Bruner back with the strength of his will. However  Beaumont appears behind him  and pushes Legendre off the cliff into the churning waters below. Beaumont loses his balance and also falls to his death  followed by a screeching vulture. Legendre's death releases Madeleine from her trance  and she awakens to embrace Neil. Neil  she says  I dreamed.

The Earl has a noble pedigree but a somewhat sordid past and a well-deserved reputation for having affairs with married women.Diana Delves Broughton is one such woman. She is the beautiful wife of Sir John Henry Delves Broughton  known to most as Jock  a man 30 years her senior. Diana has a pre-nuptial understanding with her husband that should either of them fall in love with someone else  the other will do nothing to impede the romance.Diana has indeed succumbed to the charms of the roguish Earl of Erroll  whose other lovers also include the drug-addicted American heiress Alice de Janze and the somewhat more reserved Nina Soames. The Earl is more serious about this affair than any of his earlier dalliances  and wants Diana to marry him.

to_be_classified,"The movie begins with a dinner engagement at the Thomas residence. Thaddeus Thomas (Harry Belafonte)  a wealthy CEO  prompts a discussion about White people and claims they are genetically inferior because the children grow up without fathers. In this alternative reality  the lower class consists of White Americans as the large percentage of minorities who live in rundown and crime-infested ghetto communities  and face prejudice from the broader society; while the comfortable middle to upper class is predominantly made of African Americans. The African Americans in the film are dominant in employment  business  and entertainment and they often refer condescendingly to how white children live in poverty and unfortunate conditions. The rich Thomas family are horrified and struggle to be polite in the presence of poor white people.In an effort to go above and beyond in his position  Louis Pinnock (John Travolta)  a struggling factory worker hoping for a promotion in the candy factory  offers to deliver a package after his shift. He delivers the package to successful CEO Thaddeus Thomas  who lives in a wealthy upper-class community predominantly of blacks. Pinnock is let into the property by a white servant at the security gate point in front of the Thomas residence and accidentally views Thaddeus's wife naked while dressing in her bedroom through the window. Thaddeus notices and complains to the VP at the factory  during a dinner engagement at his house  that he would prefer a different delivery man instead of a Peeping Tom to visit his house next time. Although Thaddeus doesn't suggest any form of punishment towards Pinnock  the VP gets the message and immediately fires Pinnock anyway. Pinnock returns to the Thomas residence in an attempt to discuss the misunderstanding with Thaddeus  but because Thaddeus was in an important business meeting  he refuses and sends a message to Pinnock that he apologizes but there's nothing he can do to help him. Pinnock begs for two minutes of his time  but is abruptly turned away.Without any education or advanced skills  Pinnock finds difficulty getting a job and is unable to support his family. The Pinnock family are awakened one early morning by the police who is accompanied by the landlord to enforce the eviction from the house; in mid-chaos the family struggle to gather their important belongings as they vacate the premises. Pinnock's mother-in-law scolds and belittles Louis for being a failure of a man and not taking care of his family; she clearly states there is not enough room for him at her house and his wife and the two kids leave to live with her.As if the situation could not get worse  Louis's truck breaks down and he is forced to walk. Feeling down and lonely in the midst of the night  Louis is aggressively apprehended by the police who mistaken him for a bank robber because he fit the description. The people inside the bar come outside and shout at the police  demanding that they leave Pinnock alone. Pinnock is brutally beaten by the police for causing a commotion and the police are chased away  as beer bottles are being thrown by the angry mob.In a radical quest for justice  Pinnock waits outside the Thomas residence again and kidnaps Thomas at gun point and demands for a large sum of money that is owed for losing his job. After multiple failed attempts for withdrawing the money  Pinnock holds Thomas hostage for the weekend and takes him through the ghetto where he lives. Thomas  however  remains unsympathetic to Pinnock and calls him a failure who blames the world for his problems. But Pinnock takes Thomas through the ghetto where he lives  and Thomas alternates between enjoying some of the staples of ghetto life (Pinnock shows him how to use salt to enhance the flavor of ketchup with French fries) and having his eyes open to this world's racism (black cops are hostile to Pinnock  treat him like a criminal when he's done nothing wrong  and eventually beat him up for no good reason). In the end  though mistaken for carrying a weapon  Pinnock is shot and killed by the police in an attempt to call for help for Thomas who is in desperate need for medical attention because of breathing problems. The chastened CEO visits Pinnock's grieving widow and offers her the money Louis lost when he was fired. She refuses it  and when Thomas awkwardly asks if she wants more  she bluntly says How much would ever be enough? and closes the door in his face as the movie ends."

Sam changes the lettering on the trailer of his rig to read Sam Hummer and Son.Carrol Jo begins dating Jerri and the two want to be married  but Sam dies and the trucking partnership suddenly ends. As a result  Carrol Jo joins the Air Force and is soon sent to Vietnam. While in Vietnam  Carrol Jo has a successful career and is deemed a hero  but all he wants to do is return home to Jerri. Jerri spends these years waiting for his return and this is the subject of the film's theme song Drifting and Dreaming by Valerie Carter. The opening sequence shows Carrol Jo's plane arriving from overseas as Jerri and her brother give him a hero's welcome. We see the two get married and start their life together in humble settings.Carrol Jo obtains a loan from the bank to purchase a new truck. He and Jerri then visit a local used truck sales lot where he purchases a repossessed 1974 Ford WT9000 cabover rig with a Cummins turbo diesel engine. The salesman throws in a custom paint job to seal the deal and Carrol Jo picks a blue and white paint scheme  highlighted with the words BLUE MULE. Later  the two are jubilant as they drive their new truck through the deserts around Tucson  imagining the new life that awaits them.CJ announces to the local listeners on the CB radio that he is in business for himself and is intent on getting as much as he can  so that he can get out of hock to the bank as quickly as possible.When CJ goes back to work at Red River he finds out that things are very different. Duane Haller informs him that the company is now hauling un-taxed cigarettes and slot machines and that if he wants to stay out of trouble and keep working  hell have to keep his mouth shut. CJ gets angry and forces his rig to be unloaded  vowing never to haul illegal cargo. Later  Carroll Jo is pulled over on a lonely highway and discovers that the local sheriff is in on the crooked dealing as well  when he is handcuffed to his truck. Three men from Red River then show up and break his ribs.When CJ tries to find work at other trucking companies around Tucson  he discovers that Red River has blackballed him as a troublemaker  and he is unwelcome everywhere he goes. Livid  he returns to Red River with a shotgun and threatens Duane Haller. Duane informs him that he is just a pawn in the game and that the person he actually needs to talk to is Duanes boss  Buck Wessler (L.Q. Jones). Buck is a sleazy  lower-level crook who now manages Red River. Buck agrees to let CJ take a load to Dallas  free of any contraband. Sam Hummers old friend Pops Dinwiddie decides to come along  to help keep Carroll Jo safe on his trip. En route  they are attacked by men from Red River  but manage to fight them off and continue on their way.Throughout the rest of the story  Carroll Jo tries to make a living by driving daily loads in and out of Tucson  mainly for Red River. He slowly discovers that Red River is actually owned by a large corporation based in Phoenix called the Glass House  a diversified energy and transportation company. Unbeknownst to him  though  Glass House is actually a front for organized crime. They use the trucking companies that they own as a transportation system for their syndicate and its illegal shipments.Over the course of several months  CJ tries to organize the other drivers at Red River and around Tucson to stand up to the Glass House and refuse to haul illegal cargo. In the process he is beaten  vandalized  cheated and then eventually framed for Duane Hallers murder. After his acquittal  CJ discovers the body of Pops Dinwiddie  who has been driving the Blue Mule while CJ was in jail  in his house. This leads to a climactic confrontation between all of the Red River drivers and Buck at the loading dock. Carroll Jo beats Buck  until CJs brother-in-law pulls him off of him.That night  CJ and Jerri are viciously attacked while they sleep and their house is set on fire. Carroll Jo wakes up and gets both of them out of the house before it burns down. At the hospital  the doctor informs him that Jerri has lost the baby she was carrying and will never be able to have children. CJ returns home in despair.Moments later  he emerges from the house with a shotgun and gets into the Blue Mule. He radios Deputy Bob that he is headed for the Glass House and to tell them that he is coming. Bob tries to intercept him on a two-lane road  but Carroll Jo runs the deputy off the road  destroying his patrol car. CJ shows up at the Glass House headquarters  faced by several heavily armed security guards who are waiting for him. He accelerates as fast as he can toward them  but his truck is riddled with bullets  blowing out several tires  the radiator and the windshield. CJ takes one bullet to the face. He manages to run through the security gauntlet  but he knows he wont be able to get the crippled truck all the way to the corporate headquarters  so he aims for the giant sign that stands in front of the building  an enormous two-story glass structure with the letters GH. Carroll Joe runs up an embankment leading to the sign and crashes through it  completely destroying it and his truck at the same time.In the last scene  a TV news reporter is announcing that all truckers in Tucson are on strike. The strike is being held in protest of the corrupt system set up by the Glass House and in honor of one trucker who dared to stand up against them  Carroll Jo Hummer. CJs brother-in-law wheels him out of his hospital room to the parking lot  which is filled with semi-trucks and truckers. They all begin to clap. Carroll Jo then begins to smile. Jerri is in a window directly behind him (apparently still hospitalized herself)  overlooking all of this. Her lack of a smile may indicate that she is still unsure about living her life as the wife of a whistle-blowing hero who is willing to die for his family and the truth.

Conroy meets a musher named Skunker and Alex Larson  Conroy's father's buddy  who reluctantly agrees to guide Jack to his father's claim in the Yukon. While on their journey  they are stalked by a large pack of wolves. One night  while resting at a campfire  a female wolf named Kiche manages to lure one of the sled dogs (Digger) away from the group  and another wolf appears and chases the dog into the woods. Skunker uses his ammunition to wound one wolf and gives chase to save his dog  but is killed and devoured by the rest of the pack. Later that night the wolves return but are scared off by Jack and Alex using burning branches. The following morning the wolves attack the two men  but they are saved when another sled team arrives with one of the men fatally shooting a male wolf. His pup (who is half-dog) is left to fend for himself. Jack and Alex reach a town where they plan to stay for the winter. A band of Native Americans  meanwhile  find the pup  and the chief  realizing he is not a (full) wolf from the color of his teeth  names him White Fang.As spring comes  Jack and Alex resume their quest  but stop off at the Native Americans' settlement. The chief explains that White Fang has been raised to obey  not to be friendly  but Jack seeks to change that. Jack's chance comes when he is chased and cornered by a grizzly bear. White Fang intervenes  saving Jack's life. Jack and Alex later leave the settlement. Not long after  White Fang is unfairly traded to a brutal dogfighter named Beauty Smith (who previously stole Jack's money); he blackmails the Native American for the wolfdog  saying that ownership of a wild animal is considered illegal. Smith and his gang train White Fang to be vicious in order to enter him into illegal dogfights. White Fang eventually meets his match in a brutal fight against a bulldog  but Jack happens upon the fight and intervenes in the nick of time. Having earlier reached his father's claim and begun the work of digging for gold  Jack returns with White Fang to the cabin where he seeks to transform White Fang's vicious and territorial nature.Jack's attempts to tame White Fang eventually succeed; both wolfdog and man develop a close and trusting bond. Alex helps Jack mine for gold and they strike it rich with the help of White Fang. One morning  Jack travels to the town to claim proper ownership to the gold when Luke notices White Fang with him. Seeking retaliation and planning to steal the gold  Smith and his men attack the cabin site. White Fang attacks Tinker  who accidentally discharges his gun  wounding Luke. White Fang subdues Smith until he's ordered by Jack to back down. Jack and Alex take their assailants prisoner and force them at gunpoint to haul gold ore into town.Alex and his wife offer to take Jack back to San Francisco  but he lets Jack know that city life is no place for a wolf; he must let White Fang run free in the wild. Though White Fang cannot understand why Jack is trying to leave him  Jack's efforts by using a stick (which White Fang hated/feared when he was under Smith) finally succeed in scaring the wolfdog off. Later  just as he's boarding the ship back to San Francisco  Jack realizes that his rightful place is in the Yukon and he decides to stay behind alone and live off the land; Alex congratulates him by saying that it is what Jack's father would have wanted. After a short time  White Fang returns to the cabin site where he and Jack are happily reunited.[3]"

After the vet treats him  Julie takes him home while trying to find his owners. A rapist breaks into her house and tries to attack her  but the dog protects her. She decides to adopt him  against the wishes of her boyfriend Roland Graele. Unbeknown to her  the dog was trained by a white racist to attack black people on sight. The dog sneaks out of the house  and kills a black truck driver in an attack. Later  Julie takes the dog to work with her  and he attacks a black actress on the set.Realizing something is not right with the dog  Julie takes him to a dog trainer  Carruthers  who tells her to kill the dog. Another dog trainer named Keys  who is black  undertakes training the dog as a personal challenge. He dons protective gear and keeps the dog in a large enclosure  taking him out on a chain and exposing himself to the dog each day and making sure he is the only one to feed or care for the dog.The dog escapes and kills an elderly black man in a church  after which Keys manages to recover him  and opts not to turn him over to authorities to continues the training  over Julie's protests. He warns her that the training has reached a tipping point  where the dog might be cured or go insane. He believes that curing the dog will discourage white racists from training dogs like this.After a lengthy time  it seems the dog is cured  in that he is now friendly towards Keys. Julie confronts the dog's original owner  who has come to claim him  and who presumably trained him to attack black people. She angrily tells him the dog has been cured by a black person in front of his grandchildren who knew the dog to be a loving pet.Just as Julie and Keys celebrate their victory  the dog  without warning  turns its attention to Carruthers and brutally attacks him. The dog had not previously shown any aggression towards him; no explanation for this is given  but the implication is that the dog's programming has somehow been reversed  though that was never Keys's intention  or that Carruthers has a similarity to the dog's original owner. To save his employer's life  Keys is forced to shoot and kill the dog  and the film ends with the image of the dog's body lying in the center of the training enclosure while Julie weeps over his dead body."

The woman (a sales assistant) is actually just trying to help Marcus get dressed in some very tight clothes  but Gina misinterprets them talking and assumes that Marcus is having an affair.

While thanking Latrell  Marcus peels his mask off  revealing that he is actually a black man. While Latrell is upset that Marcus is a man  his primary anger stems from the fact that Marcus is black  not that he is a man. Marcus apologizes to Gina for constantly putting work before love  and the two make up  much to Shaunice's chagrin. Denise falls for Kevin after he saves her from a bullet shot by Vandergeld when she caught his secret on film.

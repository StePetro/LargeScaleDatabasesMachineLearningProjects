In the aftermath of the battle  the victorious Zulus walk amongst the scattered bodies of dead British soldiers and gather their rifles. At a mass Zulu marriage ceremony witnessed by missionary Otto Witt (Jack Hawkins) and his daughter (Ulla Jacobsson)  Zulu King Cetewayo (Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi) is also informed of the great victory.A company of the British Army's 24th Regiment of Foot is using the missionary station of Rorke's Drift in Natal as a supply depot and hospital for their invasion force across the border in Zululand. Receiving news of Isandhlwana from the Natal Native Contingent Commander Adendorff  who warns that an army of 4 000 Zulu warriors is advancing to the British position  Lieutenant John Chard (Stanley Baker) of the Royal Engineers assumes command of the small British detachment. Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead (Michael Caine)  an infantry officer  is rather put out to find himself subordinate to an engineer due to the latter's slightly earlier commission. Realising that they cannot outrun the Zulu army with wounded soldiers  Chard decides to make a stand at the station  using wagons  sacks of mealie  and crates of ship's biscuit to form a defensive perimeter to counter the Zulu nation's deadly effective Bull tactical enveloping formation. Witt becomes drunk and demoralises the men with his overtly dire predictions; the soldiers of the Natal Native Contingent desert. Chard orders Witt to be locked up in a supply room.As the Zulu impis approach  a contingent of Boer horsemen arrives. They advise Chard that defending the station is hopeless. They retreat in haste  despite Chard's desperate pleas for them to stay. The Zulu army approach and then charge. The British open fire  but Adendorff informs them that the Zulus are only testing the British firepower. Witt again predicts the soldiers' inevitable fate  before being driven from the battle with his daughter. Chard is concerned that the northern perimeter wall is undermanned and realises that the attack will come from all sides. The defenders are surprised when the Zulu warriors open fire on the station with rifles  taken from the British dead at Isandlwana.Throughout the day and night  wave after wave of Zulu attackers are repelled. The Zulus succeed in setting fire to the hospital  leading to intense fighting between British patients and Zulu warriors as the former try to escape the flames. Private Henry Hook (James Booth) takes charge and successfully leads the patients to safety.The next morning  the Zulus approach to within several hundred yards and begin singing a war chant; the British respond by singing Men of Harlech. In the final assault  just as it seems the Zulus will finally overwhelm the tired defenders  the British soldiers fall back to a small redoubt constructed out of mealie bags. With a reserve of soldiers hidden within the redoubt  they form into three ranks and seamlessly fire volley after volley  inflicting heavy casualties; the Zulus withdraw. After a pause of three hours  the defenders are still recovering when the Zulus re-form again on the Oscarberg. Resigned to another assault  the British are astonished when the Zulus instead sing a song to honour the bravery of the defenders before departing.The film ends with another narration by Richard Burton  listing the eleven defenders who received the Victoria Cross for the defence of Rorke's Drift  the most awarded to a regiment in a single action up to that time."

to_be_classified,Basil is a British-Greek writer raised in Britain who bears the hallmarks of an uptight  middle-class Englishman. He is waiting at the Athens port of Piraeus on mainland Greece to catch a boat to Crete when he meets a gruff  yet enthusiastic Greek-Macedonian peasant and musician named Zorba. Basil explains to Zorba that he is traveling to a rural Cretan village where his father owns some land  with the intention of reopening a lignite mine and perhaps curing his writer's block. Zorba relates his experience with mining and persuades Basil to take him along.When they arrive at Crete  they take a car to the village where they are greeted enthusiastically by the town's impoverished peasant community. They stay with an old French war widow and courtesan named Madame Hortense in her self-styled Hotel Ritz. The audacious Zorba tries to persuade Basil into making a move on the much older Madame Hortense  but when he is understandably reluctant  Zorba seizes the opportunity  and they form a relationship.Over the next few days  Basil and Zorba attempt to work the old lignite mine  but find it unsafe and shut it down. Zorba then has an idea to use the forest in the nearby mountains for logging  (his specific plan is left ambiguous  but it seems he thinks the timber can be used to shore up the tunnels). The land is owned by a powerful monastery  so Zorba visits and befriends the monks  getting them drunk. Afterwards  he comes home to Basil and begins to dance in a way that mesmerizes Basil.Meanwhile  Basil and Zorba get their first introduction to the Widow  a young and attractive widowed woman  who is incessantly teased by the townspeople for not remarrying  especially to a young  local boy who is madly in love with her  but whom she has spurned repeatedly. One rainy afternoon  Basil offers her his umbrella  which she reluctantly takes. Zorba suggests that she is attracted to him  but Basil  ever shy  denies this and refuses to pursue the widow.Basil hands Zorba some money  and sends him off to the large town of Chania  where Zorba is to buy cable and other supplies for the implementation of his grand plan. Zorba says goodbye to Basil and Madame Hortense  who is by now madly in love with him. In Chania  Zorba entertains himself at a cabaret and strikes up a brief romance with a much younger dancer. In a letter to Basil  he details his exploits and indicates that he has found love. Angered by Zorba's apparent irresponsibility and the squandering of his money  Basil untruthfully tells Madame Hortense that Zorba has declared his love to her and intends to marry her upon his return  which makes her ecstatic to the point of tears. Meanwhile  the Widow returns Basil's umbrella by way of Mimithos  the village idiot.When Zorba eventually returns with supplies and gifts  he is surprised and angered to hear of Basil's lie to Madame Hortense. He also asks Basil about his whereabouts the night before. That night  Basil had gone to the Widow's house  made love to her and spent the night. The brief encounter comes at great cost. A villager catches sight of them  and word spreads  and the young  local boy who is in love with the Widow is taunted mercilessly about it. The next morning  the villagers find his body by the sea  where he has drowned himself out of shame.The boy's father  Mavrandoni  holds a funeral which the villagers attend. The widow attempts to come inconspicuously  but is blocked from entering the church. She is eventually trapped in the courtyard  then beaten and stoned by the villagers  who hold her responsible for the boy's suicide. Basil  meek and fearful of intervening  tells Mimithos to quickly fetch Zorba. Zorba arrives just as a villager  a friend of the boy  tries to pull a knife and kill the widow. Zorba overpowers the much younger man and disarms him. Thinking that the situation is under control  Zorba asks the Widow to follow him and turns his back. At that moment  the dead boy's father pulls his knife and cuts the widow's throat. She dies at once  as the villagers shuffle away apathetically  whisking the father away. Only Basil  Zorba and Mimithos show any emotion over her murder. Basil proclaims his inability to intervene whereupon Zorba laments the futility of death.On a rainy day  Basil and Zorba come home and find Madame Hortense waiting. She expresses anger at Zorba for making no progress on the wedding. Zorba conjures up a story that he had ordered a white satin wedding dress  lined with pearls and adorned with real gold. Madame Hortense presents two golden rings she had made and proposes their immediate engagement. Zorba tries to stall  but eventually agrees with gusto  to Basil's surprise.Some time later  Madame Hortense has contracted pneumonia  and is seen on her deathbed. Zorba stays by her side  along with Basil. Meanwhile  word has spread that the foreigner is dying  and since she has no heirs  the State will take her possessions and money. The desperately poor villagers crowd around her hotel  impatiently waiting for her demise so they can steal her belongings. As two old ladies enter her room and gaze expectantly at her  other women try to enter  but Zorba manages to fight them off. At the instant of her death  the women re-enter Madame Hortense's bedroom en masse to steal her valued possessions. Zorba leaves with a sigh  as the hotel is ransacked and stripped bare by the shrieking and excited villagers. When Zorba returns to Madame Hortense's bedroom  the room is barren apart from her bed (where she lies) and the bird in her cage. Zorba takes the birdcage with him.Finally  Zorba's elaborate contraption to transport timber down the hill is complete. A festive ceremony  including lamb on a spit is held  and all the villagers turned out. After a blessing from the priests  Zorba signals the start by firing a rifle in the air. A log comes hurtling down the zip line at a worrying pace  destroying the log itself and slightly damaging part of the contraption. Zorba remains unconcerned and gives orders for a second log. This one also speeds down and shoots straight into the sea. By now the villagers and priests have grown fearful and head for cover. Zorba remains unfazed and orders a third log  which accelerates downhill with such violence that it dislodges the entire contraption  destroying everything. The villagers flee  leaving Basil and Zorba behind.Basil and Zorba sit by the shore to eat roasted lamb for lunch. Zorba pretends to tell the future from the lamb shank  saying that he foresees a great journey to a big city. He then asks Basil directly when he plans to leave  and Basil replies that he will leave in a few days. Zorba declares his sadness about Basil's imminent departure to England and tells Basil that he is missing madness. Basil asks Zorba to teach him to dance. Zorba teaches him the sirtaki and Basil begins to laugh hysterically at the catastrophic outcome. The story ends with both men enthusiastically dancing the sirtaki on the beach.

He says that with the help of the editor  he found a rented house at his friend's outhouse located far away from the rest of Goan civilization. Even though the said place looks haunted  Ronnie still adjusts himself to the situation despite having a paralyzed owner  who is driven on a wheelchair throughout and who also happens to be the father of Maya (Mannara Chopra). For Maya  it is love at first sight when she sees Ronnie  who incidentally is recovering from a break-up with Priya (Shraddha Das)  his girlfriend of many years and who is now settled in London.

She calls her sister and reveals her feeling for him. She even enters Ronnie's room and picks a picture out of his photo-frame. He finds it missing  but does nothing. She spots a picture of her on his desktop (a random picture he had clicked during his ferry ride to the outhouse  before he had even met her) and assumes that he's in love with her.Ronnie is not in love with her  but thinks she is strange and cute  so he plans a date-night at a nightclub. There he bumps into a girl named Nancy (Seerat Kapoor)  who happens to be Priya's step sister. Maya's left with uncontrollable rage when sees him dancing with Nancy and they quickly leaves the bar.

The girl is found dead and Ronnie panics because he could be identified in the case. Priya comes back to India from London to hunt for Nancy's killers. Inspector Moses(Denzil Smith) suspects that Priya killed Nancy since she was her step-sister so as to covet her money and wealth and Ronnie is her partner-in-crime.In the meanwhile  Maya does everything wrong to protect and save Ronnie in this case. He tells his boss that his SUV is in the garage  but actually she dumps it in a lake so that no one can trace it ever. She even takes him to the spot and shows him the immersed SUV in the lake.Investigations reveal that Nancy had a chance to live even after she was hit by the car  but in reality someone murdered her. Priya visits Ronnie at his outhouse and requests him to help her find the murderer. Soon  they warm up to each other again. Ronnie even refuses to join Maya at her dinner date giving an excuse saying that he has a lot of pending work in the office and may be late. Actually  he was avoiding Maya so that he could spend the night with Priya. Ronnie ignores Maya's repeated calls. She then telephonically finds out from Ronnie's office that he is not there but is with Priya. Maya visits Priya's place and finds Ronnie and Priya in compromising position. She seethes with rage and returns.Maya's lunacy reaches new heights. The next day Ronnie's pet pup Bobby goes missing. he frantically searches for the pup everywhere and shockingly discovers that Maya had fed him to her pet alligator.

Ronnie arrives but she attacks him on the head from behind and he suffers a black-out.Maya rushes to leave her house  but finds Inspector Moses there. She wastes no time in killing him. Ronnie wakes up and walks into a dark cabin between the woods to find out 'everything-you-want-to-know-about-Maya'.There are her childhood and adulthood pictures pasted on the walls and his pictures  along with Nancy  Priya  Moses  Bobby (with red crosses on those who were dead). Maya reappears and reveals it all to him. She also tells him that she had killed her own sister (the dead girl on the other side of her phone) by pushing her from the boat in a lake because of jealousy and insecurity.Maya then blindfolds Ronnie and takes him to the top of a lighthouse that she called as Maya's Kingdom. Her plan is to exchange wedding vows with him. She tells him to make love to her and he obliges.All this while Priya is dangling in mid-air on a suspended chair. Ronnie lights a cigarette and spills a glass of wine over it causing a fire to break out. Maya pulls the gun on him but Ronnie snatches the gun from her hand (which he could have done earlier too) and throws her off the lighthouse. Now she's dangling from the rod along with Priya. Well eventually  Ronnie manages to pull Priya on top of the lighthouse and saves her. After that they both try saving Maya  but she lets go and falls to her death into the deep waters.The DSP is convinced by Ronnie's story and tells him that he will be out on bail. Ronnie is relieved and as he walks out the real story is revealed. It was all a game-plan by Ronnie and Priya. In quick shots they show us how he murdered Nancy  brutally killed Moses  threatened and tortured Maya to write her suicide note and eventually killed her. All this for claiming Nancy's property. In the concluding scene  Ronnie says that one just needs a good convincing story and must narrate it with genuineness. No one would care whether its true or false.
to_be_classified,"After achieving lesser godhood  Zhang Diaoxian decides that isn't enough. He assumes control over the city of Hu  getting the locals to worship his every word. It is later revealed that not every demon in Hell is deserving of their fate nor their status  and that the lesser ones want redemption for themselves rather than harm to humanity  but must play along to avoid Diaoxian's zealot demon-slayers. Zhong Kui  a local scholar  is manipulated by Diaoxian into becoming his most powerful experiment yet: a pseudo-demon capable of more effectively slaying demons with. Diaoxian wins the trust of Hu's residents in order to deceive them and the other gods into not noticing his real plans for wishing to steal away from Hell one of its most prized treasures: the Dark Crystal. With it  he seeks to overthrow the pantheon of gods and rewrite all reality - even if he has to eradicate Hell and erase the souls of all the innocent in Hu to make that possible.The current resident Demon King in the realm of Hell nearest to the city of Hu is revealed to have once been one of Diaoxian's pawns  much like Kui is presently. After Diaoxian's betrayal led to the Demon King and his followers being turned into demons and sent to Hell as Diaoxian sought to hide his crimes from the other gods; the Demon King sought to take advantage of a date when the realms were close by and reincarnations occurred as his big chance to win redemption for his clan by using the Dark Crystal to expose Diaoxian.Three years prior  he sent out several of his minions as demon girls to seduce Hu residents to his side  to even the odds against Diaoxian. One of those was Little Snow  later known as Snow Girl  a human-demon hybrid able to take on a crystalline ice form and control all things related to cold weather. She stumbled upon a younger Kui in an effort to seduce him  but was soon smitten with him herself and lost some of her zeal for revenge. However  she also discovered that Diaoxian was already indoctrinating Kui  and fled back to Hell heartbroken. Fearing that his love for Snow would lead to betrayal  Diaoxian manipulated Kui into suicide  then erased most of his memories and partially revived him. He gave a magic elixir to Kui in order to fool Kui into believing he was still fully human and alive  rather than a human-demon hybrid per an unholy resurrection.Three years later  Kui tries to master his new power of a pseudo-demon form. He also steals the Dark Crystal from Hell on Diaoxian's command. The Demon King recruits his subjects - along with some actual demons - to wage assault on the city of Hu and take the Dark Crystal back  fearing that Diaoxian's true evil plan will finally come to pass otherwise. When the initial waves of actual demons prove too weak and animalistic and fall too easily to the demon slayers  the Demon King revives Snow Girl to assist his subjects in retrieving the Dark Crystal.The Demon Sisters travel to Hu disguised as traveling dancers  to bemuse the town into drunken revelry and lust so they will be too distracted to help Diaoxian guard the crystal properly. However  a suspicious Kui feigns being drunk in order to get closer to the girls  in a quest to get them to betray their demon forms. When his initial efforts to expose them fail  he discovers Snow separated from the others. The two of them reignite their love affair  as she attempts to explain to him the truth of what's happening. Their lovemaking session is interrupted after the other girls grow impatient and try to steal the crystal without her  causing a mystical fox guardian to attack them. Kui hears the commotion and leaves to investigate. Snow arrives on the scene afterward to help her sisters out  and comes across Kui in his demon form  the two of them confused to find themselves fighting on opposite sides. They trade blows  but Diaoxian arrives and the demon girls are defeated. Snow tries to escape and feign innocence  but Kui isn't fooled. Realizing she went out of her way not to hurt anyone except in self-defense  Kui gives in to both his love for Snow and to her pleading for mercy  and decides he can't bring himself to kill her. Instead  he has her hide with his siblings.Diaoxian fears the girls might betray the truth to the residents of Hu  so he stirs up hatred against them and tries to orchestrate a public execution to send them back to Hell  in a weakened state where it could take centuries before they are strong enough to return to Earth. Snow hears her sisters being publicly tortured  so she heads out in public to rescue them. By herself  she proves no match for Diaoxian  who quickly defeats her and exposes her in public. Diaoxian demands that Kui execute Snow publicly for the crime of humiliating him with icicles. However  Kui refuses to kill her  instead pleading for her life. Diaoxian responds by stabbing Kui with a poisonous blade. More of the Demon King's forces advance in an effort to rescue Snow and Kui  with Kui's demon form able to understand the intentions of the demon girls and his loyalties shifting following his disillusionment with Diaoxian's cruel and merciless demeanor. Struggling with the poison  he ultimately decides to let a demon go back to Hell peacefully rather than kill it. Diaoxian scolds him for this  and Snow flees to the outskirts of town. She and her sisters meet up with Kui later  healing his poison with some stolen elixir. Kui agrees to go to Hell with them and meet up with the Demon King to learn the truth.Kui then goes to confront Diaoxian  learning even more the true nature of his former master. He threatens to expose Diaoxian's evil plan to the townsfolk  but learns the hard way that Diaoxian's deceptions have the town completely under his spell. The townsfolk turn against Kui  beating him until he becomes enraged and his demon form manifests. Even then  he refuses to attack his countrymen - except as a last resort in self-defense. A bitter  wounded  betrayed Kui flees to the outskirts of the realms in an effort to make sense of his broken reality  with Snow chasing after him to comfort him and remind him of their love.The two of them decide to stage a final assault on Diaoxian in order to separate him from the Dark Crystal  so that the balance of reality can be restored and the residents of Hu saved from being the fuel to Diaoxian's reality-warping engine. The city's royal guard interferes  slowing Kui down as he's forced to fight his former demon-slayer comrades and overcome them. Snow tackles Diaoxian by herself  openly chastising him for his never-ending treachery. However  the fight goes poorly for her. He is able to imprison her in a crystalline structure suspended in the air  significantly weakening her life force so that she'll need to reincarnate in Hell before gaining another chance at redemption centuries later  possibly dooming her to go through numerous reincarnations as a pseudo-demon before transcending to human - or godhood.Kui catches up and notices Snow's predicament. He seems stunned and helpless at first  but flies into a rage when Diaoxian mocks the lovers' commitment to each other. Diaoxian soon discovers that he exhausted much of his own energy supply trying to imprison Snow Girl  then exhausts what's left trying to create an energy pyramid to shield himself from an enraged Zhong Kui in full demon form. Kui  finally fed up  uses his hidden sword to shatter the compromised shield  leaving a weakened Diaoxian exposed and vulnerable. Kui slices Diaoxian into four pieces  seemingly killing him. This causes the crystal imprisoning Snow to disintegrate  sending her falling to the ground. Kui catches her  but she is too weak. Dying and in pain  she retreats in spirit form to Hell to recuperate. However  the July 15th special event is nearly at an end. If Kui doesn't save her from Hell in time  it could be thousands of years before her next reincarnation can hope to escape demon life. Kui restores the chi spirits of the townsfolk stolen by Diaoxian with the Dark Crystal's help  and the disillusioned townsfolk realize that Kui was right to rebel against Diaoxian.As the time comes for Kui to reincarnate and shed his demon form for good  one of the other gods of the Chinese pantheon confronts him and encourages him to enter Heaven alone. Kui refuses to ascend to godhood without Snow Girl by his side  so he instead plunges himself into Hell in his demon form in the hopes of finding and saving her before it's too late - accepting the possibility that he too might be trapped for thousands of years in his demon form  yet unwilling to spend any more amount of time anywhere unless Snow is with him."

to_be_classified,"Victorian adventurer and sexologist Sir Richard Francis Burton (John Robinson)  following an unfortunate encounter with the Fountain of Youth in 1892  is 170 years old and living in Toronto  Canada. Burton  now living and working as the chief taxidermist at a Museum of Natural History  is searching for a centerpiece display for an exhibit in his Hall of Contagion. He comes up with the idea of featuring AIDS and the Patient Zero hypothesis. Accepting the popular belief that Zero introduced the virus to North America  Burton sets out to collect video footage from those who knew Zero to support the hypothesis. When Zero's doctor (Brenda Kamino)  mother (Charlotte Boisjoli) and former airline colleague Mary (Dianne Heatherington)  who is now with ACT UP  all refuse to demonize Zero  Burton manipulates the footage to make it appear as if they do and includes doctored photographs of Zero showing signs of Kaposi's sarcoma. He presents this preliminary version to the press.The ghost of Zero (Normand Fauteux) materializes at a local gay bathhouse. No one can see or hear him  until Zero runs into Burton while Burton is spying on Zero's friend George. Zero realizes that Burton can see him  although Zero does not show up on Burton's video camera. The two strike a deal; Zero agrees to help Burton with his Patient Zero exhibit if Burton finds a way to make Zero appear.The two return to the museum where Burton makes a ridiculous attempt to seduce Zero to ensure his participation. Rejecting his advances  Zero examines some of the other exhibits (including displays on Typhoid Mary and the Tuskegee syphilis study) before finding an African green monkey  another suspected early AIDS vector. The monkey (Marla Lukofsky) angrily denounces Zero for scapegoating her just as he has been scapegoated. Zero turns to Burton and they make love.Under pressure from his director and the exhibit's drug manufacturer sponsor  Burton steals Zero's medical records in hopes of discovering new information. Zero and Burton examine an old blood sample of Zero's under a microscope and discover Miss HIV (Michael Callen)  who points out that the original study that was used to label Patient Zero as the first person to bring HIV to North America did not prove any such thing  but instead helped prove that HIV was sexually transmitted  leading to the development of safer sex practices. Under this interpretation  Zero could be lauded as a hero for his candor in participating in that original study. As Burton ponders this  an unknown fluid squirts from the eye pieces of the microscope  drenching Zero and making him appear on video. He joyously declares his innocence on tape but the effect only lasts five minutes before he fades away again. Zero angrily accuses Burton of not caring for him at all and only wanting to use him for the exhibit  then storms out.Burton fails to complete the revised Patient Zero exhibit before its scheduled opening date. The museum curator substitutes the original presentation instead over Burton's protests  leading to a renewed rush of press scapegoating Zero. The night after the exhibit opens  Mary and other ACT UP members break into the Hall of Contagion and trash the exhibit. Zero returns and Burton explains that he tried to stop the exhibit. Zero forgives Burton but says he wants to disappear again completely. Zero merges with his disfigured video image and  smoking a cigarette inside the video  sets off the fire alarm. The sprinklers destroy the video player and Zero vanishes.A major subplot involves George (Richardo Keens-Douglas)  a French teacher and former intimate of Zero's. George is losing his sight to cytomegalovirus and is taking a drug that is manufactured by a company that  as a member of ACT UP  George is protesting. George struggles through the film to resolve his conflicted feelings over this  his guilt over abandoning Zero during the final days of his illness and his fear that the same thing will happen to him."

In 2003 she is stationed at the U.S. embassy in Pakistan. She and fellow officer Dan  attend the blacksite interrogations of Ammar  a detainee with suspected links to several of the 2001 hijackers in the September 11 attacks  who is subjected to approved torture interrogation techniques. Ammar provides unreliable information on a suspected attack in Saudi Arabia  but does reveal to Maya the previously unknown name of the personal courier for bin Laden  Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Other detainee intelligence connects courier traffic by Abu Ahmed between Abu Faraj al-Libbi and bin Laden. In 2005  Faraj denies knowing about a courier named Abu Ahmed; she interprets this as an attempt by Faraj to conceal the importance of Abu Ahmed.In 2009  during the Camp Chapman attack  Maya's fellow officer and friend Jessica is killed. On the same day a case manager that likes the Abu Ahmed lead  shares with her an interrogation with a Jordanian detainee claiming to have personally buried Abu Ahmed in 2001. Maya learns what the CIA was told five years earlier  that Morocco caught Ibrihim Sayeed traveling under the name of Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Realizing her lead may be alive  Maya contacts Dan  now a senior officer at the CIA headquarters. She speculates that the CIA's photograph of Abu Ahmed is that of his brother  Habeeb  who was killed in Afghanistan. Maya says that their beards and native clothes make all of the brothers look alike. This would explain Ammar's account of Abu Ahmed's death in 2001.Maya wants the telephone number of Ibrihim Sayeed's mother  and it comes from a Kuwaiti prince for the price of a Lamborghini. CIA operatives use electronic methods to pinpoint a caller in a vehicle who persistently exhibits tradecraft behaviors that delay confirmation of his identity. The vehicle is physically tracked to a large urban compound in Abbottabad  Pakistan  near the Pakistan Military Academy. Gunmen attack Maya while she is in her vehicle; the action indicates to the agency that her cover is blown  so she is recalled to Washington  D.C.When the compound is put under surveillance  the habits and culture of the inhabitants are analyzed but no conclusive photographic identification of bin Laden is obtained. The President's National Security Advisor tasks the CIA with creating a plan to capture or kill bin Laden. Two stealth helicopters from Area 51 are flown by the Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment to enter Pakistan  insert members of DEVGRU and the CIA's SAD/SOG and raid the compound. Before briefing President Barack Obama  the CIA Director holds a meeting of his senior officers  who assess that bin Laden being there is a chance of 6080%  rather than another high-value target. Maya  also in attendance  uses the habits intelligence to shore-up her conclusion to 100% that bin Laden is there.The raid is approved and is executed on May 2  2011. A helicopter crashes  the SEALs gain entry and kill a number of people within the compoundamong them a man in the building who is believed to be bin Laden. At a U.S. base in Jalalabad  Afghanistan  Maya visually confirms the identity of the corpse. Maya is seen boarding a military transport to return to the U.S.; the only passenger in the vast interior.

At Friedrichshafen  he meets his long-time friend Professor Altschul (Marius Goring)  who lives with his beautiful and much younger wife  Erika (Elke Sommer)  both of whom are scientists working on the new airship. Erika suspects that Geoffrey may be up to something  but keeps her suspicions to herself.Geoffrey quickly learns that German Intelligence did not bring him to Germany for a family reunion. Following a meeting with Intelligence Colonel Hirsch (Anton Diffring)  he is assigned to the LZ36 on its maiden test flight. As soon as it is declared airworthy  to maintain absolute secrecy without first returning to base  the airship is to take part in a military operation to steal or destroy British historical documents  including the Magna Carta  from Balcoven Castle in Scotland. Geoffrey is to play a key role in the mission  to use his knowledge of the Scottish countryside to guide the airship very close to the castle at night while the craft is in glide mode  with its engines off. After leaving Germany  the zeppelin lands on a lake in Norway to refuel and take on board a specially trained squad of soldiers.Geoffrey misdirects the craft's wireless operator just long enough to send a message about the LZ36's location to British intelligence. The wireless operator returns and  upon hearing the reply and realizing what Geoffrey had done  engages him in a fight. Geoffrey manages to knock him out  and throws him out an open window  telling the captain the wireless operator had fallen while scraping ice off the airship  as many craft personnel had been ordered to do. The explanation is believed  but Geoffrey does not have a chance to send any more information because Erika comes on the scene and removes an important radio component. The airship proceeds to Balcoven Castle.Under cover of darkness Geoffrey navigates the airship on its final approach to the castle. A local farmer hears the sound of the airship's engines just before they are cut  and raises the alarm with the local military base  but he is not immediately believed. Geoffrey has no option but to participate in the assault  but manages to slip away to try to raise the alarm. He persuades a sceptical radio operator to contact London  but after being wounded by German soldiers  the dying operator mistakes Geoffrey for a German spy and shoots him in the arm. The German attack on the castle is initially successful  but the historical documents they are after are in vaults inaccessible to them.Meanwhile  alerted by the farmer's report and the radio operator's chaotic call  the British Admiralty scrambles several aircraft squadrons and dispatches ground troops. The British troops engage the Germans in a firefight  who withdraw empty-handed rather than risk losing the Zeppelin. The airship manages to slip away in the dark with a much depleted crew  but shortly after first light is caught by pursuing British aircraft. Several aircraft are shot down in the ensuing dogfight  but the Zeppelin is badly damaged. Despite desperately lightening the airship in an effort to stay in the air  the survivors are forced to crash-land near the coast of the neutral Netherlands.

to_be_classified,"Zeiram (Mizuho Yoshida) is an alien of unknown origin. It appears to be a very large  imposing humanoid wearing a wide  circular hat and a ragged cloak  and its appearance is usually accompanied (at least on the film's soundtrack) by an eerie chant. However  its true form is actually the small Noh-like face on its hat. This face is its only weak point; the rest of the body is almost indestructible and regenerates quickly as long as Zeiram is able to feed  which it does by extending the little face on the end of a fleshy tentacle to take bites out of people. By doing this  it also absorbs the genetic material of its victims  which it uses to generate smaller  weaker monsters to do its bidding. These monsters seem to be partial clones of whatever creature's genetic material was used in their creation (in Zeiram 2  a dog is killed by Zeiram and the resulting monster looks vaguely canine). Zeiram itself is able to change its own form to a large degree  and appears in many different forms throughout the series. It can produce many different weapons such as guns and swords from its body  although these are probably weapons taken from its victims and stored inside itself. In addition to consuming organic tissue through its core  if it sustains enough damage  Zeiram is able to ingest a victim's entire body  keeping that person alive for some time inside itself while it digests them  regenerating itself and drawing on their genetic material and even their memories to create more advanced clones.Although the core face is Zeiram's only weak point  even that may be impossible to permanently destroy. In Zeiram 2  the creature's core  which was presumed dead  is recovered by a shadowy organisation which installs it as the organic core of a robotic supersoldier. This new cyborg Zeiram starts out bearing a mild resemblance to its precursor  before it lost the hat and cloak in favour of an appearance patterned after a classic Japanese fox-spirit  or kitsune. The actual core of Zeiram is visible on the robot's stomach. Naturally  even in an artificial body Zeiram cannot be controlled  and it goes on a killing spree. It is possible that Zeiram itself is partly biomechanical  since even in IRIA it is shown to be able to infect and control computers.Although Zeiram is usually referred to as a male  at least in subtitles  the face which serves as its core seems to be female. Indeed  some of its mutations quite visibly possess female breasts. Its partially regenerated appearance in Zeiram 2 might suggest that its original form was that of a miniature female humanoid.Zeiram is reasonably intelligent  although it doesn't seem to be able to speak or understand human language. Just how intelligent is up for debate  since it spends most of its time mindlessly killing everything in sight."

The father tries to convince his son  Tim  that the bear should be donated to the zoo. Tim refuses  equating the zoo to a prison. Branch proceeds to tell Tim about another boy who faced a similar decision:Chris Carlyle lives in the countryside  where he has befriended an adult male mountain lion named Sunshine. Because Chris has treated the cat as a pet since it was a cub  it is very docile and accustomed to eating human foods. When Chris' parents inform him that they are moving to the city  Chris worries that Sunshine will not survive alone in the wild. Unbeknownst to his parents  Chris sneaks Sunshine onto the back of the family's truck and brings him to their new home in the suburbs  where the mountain lion's presence quickly frightens the neighbors. Zoo director Dr. Del Hartwood  his assistant Isobel Moon  and head zookeeper Branch convince Chris to donate Sunshine to the city zoo.When Chris visits the zoo  he is saddened to see that the animals are confined to cramped cages made of chain-link fencing. After having a nightmare about being locked in a cage himself  Chris resolves to free Sunshine. Seeing that Chris has a bond with the mountain lion  the zoo staff offer him a summer job as a junior zookeeper. Dr. Hartwood complains to members of the city's Parks and Recreation Commission that the zoo is under-funded and its facilities woefully outdated  which has resulted in injuries to some of the animals  but is advised that the politicians are unlikely to help unless pressured by public opinion.A trio of troublemaking boys harass the zoo animals  feeding cigars to a hippopotamus. While the staff are dealing with this  Chris steals Branch's keys and opens all of the cages  setting the animals loose to wander the city. This results in a series of comedic situations including an ostrich swallowing a portable radio  a bear riding a bicycle through the streets  a zebra getting into a family's kitchen  an Asian elephant drinking a man's bathwater  and several primates invading a toy store. Public panic ensues  and the zoo staff scramble to round up the animals before the police start killing them. Councilman Pew blames Dr. Hartwood for the escape and demands his resignation. After a few hours  most of the animals have either returned to the zoo on their own or have been recaptured. The police corner Chris and Sunshine in a warehouse and are ready to shoot the mountain lion  but Dr. Hartwood manages to calm the cat by feeding it whipped cream.To protect Chris and Dr. Hartwood  Branch turns himself in and claims that he released the animals in order to draw public attention to the plight of the zoo. At Branch's trial  Chris confesses  unwilling to let Branch take the blame. Dr. Hartwood passionately defends Chris' actions as being motivated by his love of animals  and for having shaken up the public's apathy toward the zoo. The judge dismisses the case and orders Chris to spend two hours each day working at the zoo for the rest of the summer.As Branch concludes the story  he proudly shows Tim the new and improved zoo voted on by the city council. The fence cages have been replaced by modern  roomier  open-air exhibits. Chris works there  happily caring for Sunshine in the mountain lion's new home. Tim consents to give the bear cub to the zoo  believing that it will be happy there.

His proximity to his former teacher compels him to pay a visit  only to learn that Hikonoichi was recently killed while traveling  and his daughter Sayo has been sold into prostitution to repay the money lent to her father by local business man Tatsugoro. Zatoichi sets out to free Sayo  only to discover that the entire village is suffering -- victims of a scheme that has either forced their daughters into prostitution  or into doing the bidding of Tatsugoro  who is working for the corrupt Intendant  Isoda. Sayo provides him with the toggle of a medicine pouch  recovered from her father's hand.While intentionally baiting Hikonoichi's killer by jingling the toggle  Ichi befriends the local Dice Dealer Denroku (the Weasel) and his daughter  Tsuru. The girl's cheerful and idealistic nature reminds him of Sayo. The following day  while Ichi enjoys a profitable run of dice in the gambling house  a Ronin that had been observing him since his arrival bets 100 Ry against Ichi's cane (which he knows to be a sword). When Denroku attempts to cheat  Ichi exposes his sleight of hand -- revealing that his own bet won. The Ronin calmly departs  with a warning that the two of them are not finished. Tatsugoro's men try to balk on paying  but Zatoichi easily overpowers them and takes his winnings from their chest  then tosses a single Ry coin to the dealer -- a tip  to shame him -- and leaves. The men confront Ichi to reclaim the 100 Ry  but five are killed by Ichi and the survivors flee. Denroku apologizes  explaining that he was instructed to switch the dice  though Zatoichi reveals that he bears him no ill-will  remarking on his own past dealings with Yakuza. Grateful  Denroku explains that the Ronin is Koheita Kadokura -- Tatsugoro's chief enforcer. Zatoichi tells Denroku to take good care of his daughter  then leaves -- with the man performing his dice flourish as a gesture of respect to him.Tatsugoro is outraged at the incident and confronts Kadokura over it. The swordsman reveals Zatoichi's identity to him  theorizing that he's close to tracing Hikonoichi's murder back to them because of the medicine toggle. The arrival of Tax Inspector Jingo Odate panics Tatsugoro and Isoda  who plans to bribe him with 100 Ry. Kadokura knows Odate -- a respectable Samurai -- and remarks that he cannot be bribed for any sum  then offers to kill both Odate and Zatoichi in exchange for the sum. He intercepts Odate while on horseback to confront Isoda over his fraud and waylays him. He next confronts Zatoichi while drinking sake at the inn  and offers him a drink before demanding he set the time for their battle. Ichi allows him to choose  and Kadokura declares they'll fight at dusk at Utsune Bridge -- where he killed Hikonoichi. Tatsugoro uses the losses at the dice hall to extort Denroku -- demanding that he steal Zatoichi's sword  or hand Tsuru over to him  to be used in the brothel (unaware that she overheard them). Isoda instructs Tatsugoro to rally their men in order to launch a mass attack on Zatoichi  further declaring that they'll frame him for the murder of Odate.Kadokura attacks Zatoichi at the bridge  where he reveals that Intendant Isoda ordered Hikonoichi's death. When he doesn't rise to his feet  Kadokura moves to finish him off  but Zatoichi gets up and wounds him. The swordsman attempts to continue the fight  but is quickly dispatched by Zatoichi. In the village  Tsuru steals Zatoichi's sword and brings it to her father. Denroku  depressed at seeing his influence in the act  gets drunk and staggers about the village in search of Tatsugoro. He arrives at a noodle stand  where he orders more sake and drunkenly bemoans his predicament -- that the loss of his only child is the same as the loss of a blind man's cane. Zatoichi then reveals himself  in place of the stand's proprietor  and compels Denroku to lead an honest life for Tsuru's sake.With his sword reclaimed  Zatoichi then moves to confront both Tatsugoro and Isoda at the Intendant's home and takes them hostage. With Denroku's help  he destroys the legal bonds used to control the people and redistributes their money to them. Tatsugoro's and Isoda's men ambush Zatoichi and a fight ensues  resulting in dozens of them slain by Ichi. During the confusion  Denroku picks up a discarded sword and -- thanks to his years of perfecting his dice skills -- surprises himself with his skill in fighting with a katana.Both Tatsugoro and Isoda are killed at the entrance of the brothel  in front of the very women they'd exploited. The next morning  Sayo  Denroku  and Tsuru all meet at Hikonoichi's grave marker  where they discover that Zatoichi has already visited ...

to_be_classified,Zatoichi comes to a village which is the local hub of family farms in a silk growing region. The most prominent villager is Matsugoro who apparently will stop at nothing to bring all under his control. The small village does have a kind doctor  Dr. Junan  who lives with his daughter Oshizu.Boss Matsugoro appears to be very prosperous. As a minor gangster he has a large retinue of toughs he uses to bully and intimidate others and he owns a silk weaving factory where at least some of his weavers work to service debt and are actually in bondage. He has also acquired some appointed local political position from which he plans to gain more benefits.Into this situation enters a group of fugitives - criminals who have caused a lot of trouble elsewhere and have a reputation for shocking and unnecessary cruelty. Amongst this group of men is one woman - Oaki. Also amongst these men is Ogano  the disowned son of Dr. Junan from whom he's been estranged since Ogano killed a man 5 years ago in the town of Edo.The fugitives and Boss Matsugoro reach an arrangement where he will allow them to hide out above his weaving factory and they will do some unnamed strong arm favors for him when asked.Zatoichi and the fugitives have some minor clashes due to their pugnacity but Ogano prevents these situations from escalating as he knows Zatoichi could easily kill his fellow ruffians if provoked because he witnessed Zatoichi slice a snake in half as it fell through the air from a tree branch when he happened to pass Zatoichi eating his lunch in the woods previously.Zatoichi and Boss Matsugoro have a final falling out when Zatoichi compels him to allow a sick weaver to return home with her father  release her from compulsory service and burn her bond papers. Matsugoro orders his henchmen to get rid of the troublesome Zatoichi and they wound him severely but he escapes and goes into hiding.Believing Dr. Junan or his daughter Oshizu to know Zatoichi's whereabouts  Matsugoro has his men severely beat the doctor but he refuses to talk. They then take his daughter away and since she won't talk either  Matsugoro orders his men to strip her naked and hang her up. Just as they begin to struggle with her Zatoichi appears to rescue Oshizu and Dr. Junan.Still weak and severely wounded from his previous fight  Zatoichi nevertheless defeats those holding Oshizu and instructs a redeemed Oaki to lead her to her father back at the factory. The women are discovered by some of Matsugoro's men and are about to be questioned when Zatoichi appears and kills all but 1 who runs to warn Matsugoro.This leads to a large running sword battle inside Matsugoro's house where many of his men and finally Matsugoro himself are slain by Zatoichi.Following the house battle Zatoichi goes outside to rest and is set upon by the fugitives  all of whom he kills until only Ogano is left to face him. Just as their battle is about to begin the women and Dr. Junan arrive to witness Zatoichi swiftly put an end to Ogano's life.Oshizu cradles her brother's dead body and cries while Zatoichi backs up and then begins to walk away  alone again as the background song says only the cicadas cry ....

She tells him this when he asks and they part coolly.At night he encounters a group of samurai looking for a girl. They leave and Ichi discovers the man they have just mortally wounded. He asks Ichi to protect a girl named Mitsu  the girl for whom the others are looking  and escort her to Edo (the capital  nowadays called Tokyo) where her family can protect her. He finds the exceptionally well-dressed girl hiding in a nearby shed. Ichi kills two men who come into the shed looking but another man escapes. Sometime during their travel Mitsu reveals that she is being hunted because she stabbed the local lord in the face with her hairpin when he tried to rape her.They reach an inn where Hisa is also staying with Jingoro  the man who hired Hisa's husband. Confessing to be low on cash  Ichi asks the proprietress if she can ask if anyone wishes for a massage so he can earn money to pay for the accommodation. Jingoro accepts so he can find out about Ichi. Ichi orders Mitsu not to leave their room. While giving the massage Hisa  whose presence Ichi detected  leaves the room. When asked if he is Zatoichi  Ichi denies this and says Zatoichi is a fool for having learned the sword as now people always want to kill him. Ichi senses the man going for his sword  he grabs it  wraps the sageo (cord around the sheath) around the handle so it can't be used and throws it across the room.and then gives a very hard massage for which he charges a huge amount. Meanwhile  Hisa has talked to Mitsu and convinced her of Ichi's ill intent. Hisa leaves with Mitsu.At the palanquin service  Hisa's insistence on haste alerts Tomegoro  the owner  who decides there is money to be made by taking the girl himself and he orders his men to cast Hisa out. Ichi finds Hisa in the street and learns that Jingoro works for Boss Tobei Shimozuma.

As she reaches to wipe food from her face he violently grabs her hand and tells her to stay still and then despatches the three samurai who charge at them. Arriving at the next town Mitsu asks him to come with her so she can meet her family and when he is reluctant she gets him to confess that if he doesn't leave her now he will be unable to ever let her go which pleases her before he says he is joking. Even as she is sitting in her palanquin she begs him to visit.Sitting on a boat Ichi overhears that the two bosses are going to fight as Boss Hikozo has arrived home. Tomegoro goes to Doyama to see Hikozo and find Ichi and kidnap Mitsu. Ichi arrives at Hikozo's house.

The young man  Matsu  who serves Ichi sake reveals he loves a girl named Mitsu.Hisa and another man waylay Mitsu on the road and take her to Boss Tobei. They plan to use her to control Ichi. Hikozo launches a dawn raid by boat and Shimozuma drags Mitsu out against Hisa's protests that taking a girl to a fight is wrong. Tobei lets Mitsu call out and orders Ichi out of the fight and he concedes  even to the point of returning his money and conferring with Tobei about killing the two bosses on the other side which is Tobei's main objective.Ichi starts the fight and in the confusion manages to isolate Tobei with Hikozo and Tomegoro and he kills all three. Other men arrive and flee in panic when Ichi faces them. He returns to the main street and when confronted by Matsu tells him to leave. Mitsu is unharmed  apparently with Hisa's help  and flies into Ichi's arms again. Tobei's men arrive in force with Jingoro  whom Ichi says deserves to die  and threaten Ichi. He gives money to Matsu to take Mitsu to the ferry. As they leave he calls them back and almost returns to her her kerchief which she dropped before he sent here away the first time but he changes his mind. Her then kills Jingoro and any man who approaches.Waiting on the road Matsu realises Mitsu is the girl that Ichi talked about fondly and that by giving them money Ichi was signalling that he wouldn't be with them. Ichi is seen walking off alone again.

to_be_classified,Ichi travels to the village of Itakura to pay respects at the grave of a man he killed two years earlier. At the grave he reminisces on a fight between the two yakuza gangs (Iioka and Sasagawa from an earlier film) one man ran away and  though Ichi was not taking part in the fight  attacked Ichi. The dead man's sister  Chiyo  overhears Ichi say this to himself.Ichi is invited to take part in a village celebration: after three years of drought and near famine they and seventeen other villages in Usui county have raised 1 000 Ryo with which to pay taxes to the local intendant. Ichi gladly joins in while the locals sing of their hero Chuji- who lives in the hills with a troupe  hiding from the constabulary while protecting the villagers. As they transport the gold to the local intendant (Gundayu) they are ambushed by three samurai (led by Jushiro  who wields a whip) and then by a larger band. Several of the villagers are slain and the rest flee. When the robbers chase the chest of gold to the base of the hill  they find Ichi sitting atop it smoking his pipe. He kills several men when attacked and the rest flee. In the village the local men accost Ichi  blaming him for its theft  before he promises to find the gold. The conversation is overheard by a well dressed woman called Ogin. Taking the backroads to avoid government checkpoints he encounters her again. When she questions his motive for being on the backroad he replies that he could not tell  as he is blind and then asks her why she is on the same road.In the onsen at her destination Ogin takes a private room only for Ichi to rise from the water. He recognizes her and reassures her that he is blind and can see nothing (else he would be peeking  and at this he squirts two men who are peeping through a window on the roof) and they briefly talk. When she leaves she sees the sister  Chiyo  and asks why she has been following Ichi from Itakura. On Mt Akagi several of Chuji's troupe inform him that some of the men were killed by a blind man with a sword  only for Ichi to arrive to ask Chuji why he stole the money. Ichi informs the bandit that some of his men have gone rogue and stolen the chest of gold- though the two men are quick to confess and ask that he kill them for their acts. Losing his taste for the bandit life style  Chuji decides to leave and asks Ichi to take a different route- in order to escort the young nephew of one of the troupe to safety  before thanking Ichi for his faith in him.In the nearby town  Ogin (the lover of Monji)  accompanied by Chiyo  tells Monji about Ichi going to the bandtis and Monji promises revenge for the sister. Monji has just been promoted to head of the local constabulary and received his jitte (one pronged iron truncheon) as mark of office. He organizes a number of men to capture Ichi and the bandits on Mt Akagi. Ichi hears them coming and raises the alarm system the bandits set up at the bottom of the mountain  attracting the police and killing many of them to allow the others more time to escape. However the others are soon trapped and die defending their boss.The next morning in an inn  Monji talks with Jushiro that their plan  but the other two samurai are disgruntled at being treated poorly when they learn of a blind gambler doing well at the dice hall. They approach him and after Jushiro cuts a mon coin in half by throwing his sword in the air  they bet Ichi 35 Ry that he can't do the same. He accepts and wins. Outside  he confronts the two samurai whose conversation he overheard. While they deny knowledge  one of them inadvertently reveals the intendant's involvement. Ichi pays them 10 Ry  but they still attack him and are killed.The Itakura village headman pleads for Intendant Gundayu to be lenient as the tax money was stolen. Gundayu accuses the headman of lying  insisting that the tax be paid in ten days. Jushiro talks to Gundayu  with Monji present  and reveals that Gundayu is the recipient of the stolen 1000 Ry and demands more money. Ichi arrives and Jushiro calls Ichi a worm  though he wants to kill him privately so that the other two men get no pleasure from seeing their enemy killed. Monji orders his men to capture Ichi but Jushiro knocks them back with his whip  saying they will only die and Ichi leaves unmolested. Gundayu orders the headman and three other village men executed at dawn. On his return to Itakura  Ichi is mobbed  but they stop when some calls him a blind fool and his demeanour changes. He leaves and Chiyo follows him. He says he sensed who she was from the start and she pleads with Ichi to save them.The Itakura villagers had hoped to launch an attack against Gandayu's troops  believing they have nothing to lose  but lose heart when it's learned that he has deployed eight musketeers as part of his force. However  Zatoichi launches a surprise attack and succeeds in killing the riflemen. Learning of this  Monji and Gundayu panic. Gundayu starts to destroy written evidence of the crime  saving himself while implicating Monji  when Monji demands half the gold  only to be killed by Gundayu. Ichi arrives as Gundayu flees and says Gundayu can atone by giving the farmers a receipt for their taxes and returning the gold to them. He attacks Ichi and is killed. Jushio arrives and says he does not want the gold but to meet him at Bodai Temple in an hour. Chiyo is waiting for Ichi and he gives her the gold. He also gives his gambling winnings for a proper headstone for her brother. Chiyo  possibly taken with Ichi  pleads with him to stay for the forthcoming celebration in the village.Jushiro arrives at the duel on a horse and wraps his whip around Ichi's neck  dragging him along behind and causing Ichi to drop his sword. However  Jushiro drags him back past his sword.

The Brutals live in a wasteland  growing food for the Eternals  who live apart in the Vortex  leading a luxurious but aimless existence on the grounds of a country estate. The connection between the two groups is through Brutal Exterminators  who kill and terrorize other Brutals at the orders of a huge flying stone head called Zardoz  which supplies them with weapons in exchange for the food they collect. Zed (Sean Connery)  a Brutal Exterminator  hides aboard Zardoz during one trip  temporarily killing its Eternal operator-creator Arthur Frayn (Niall Buggy).Arriving in the Vortex  Zed meets two Eternals  Consuella (Charlotte Rampling) and May (Sara Kestelman). Overcoming him with psychic powers  they make him a prisoner and menial worker within their community. Consuella wants Zed destroyed immediately; others  led by May and a subversive Eternal named Friend (John Alderton)  insist on keeping him alive for further study.In time  Zed learns the nature of the Vortex. The Eternals are overseen and protected from death by the Tabernacle  an artificial intelligence. Given their limitless lifespan  the Eternals have grown bored and corrupt. The needlessness of procreation has rendered the men impotent and meditation has replaced sleep. Others fall into catatonia  forming the social stratum the Eternals have named the Apathetics. The Eternals spend their days stewarding mankind's vast knowledgethrough a voice recognition based search enginebaking special bread for themselves from the grain deliveries and participating in communal meditation rituals. To give time and life more meaning the Vortex developed complex social rules whose violators are punished with artificial aging. The most extreme offenders are condemned to permanent old age and the status of Renegades. Eternals who somehow managed to die  usually through some fatal accident  are then reborn into another healthy  synthetically reproduced body that is identical to the one they just lost.Zed is less brutal and far more intelligent than the Eternals think he is. Genetic analysis reveals he is the ultimate result of long-running eugenics experiments devised by Arthur Fraynwho is Zardozwho controlled the outlands with the Exterminators  thus coercing the Brutals to supply the Vortices with grain. Zardoz's aim was to breed a superman who would penetrate the Vortex and save mankind from its hopelessly stagnant status quo. The women's analysis of Zed's mental images earlier had revealed that in the ruins of the old world Arthur Frayn first encouraged Zed to learn to read  then led him to the book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Zed finally understands the origin of the name ZardozWizard of Ozbringing him to a true awareness of Zardoz as a skillful manipulator rather than an actual deity. He becomes infuriated with this realization and decides to plumb the deepest depths of this enormous mystery.As Zed divines the nature of the Vortex and its problems  the Eternals use him to fight their internecine quarrels. Led by Consuella  the Eternals decide to kill Zed and to age Friend. Zed escapes and  aided by May and Friend  absorbs all the Eternals' knowledge  including that of the Vortex's origin  to destroy the Tabernacle. Zed helps the Exterminators invade the Vortex and kill most of the Eternalswho welcome death as a release from their eternal but boring existence. A few Eternals do escape the Vortex's destruction  heading out to radically new lives as fellow mortal beings among the Brutals. Zed brings the immortals salvation by bringing them death.Zardoz ends in a wordless sequence of images accompanied by the sombre second movement (allegretto) of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony  snatches of which are heard throughout the film. Consuella  having fallen in love with Zed  gives birth to a baby boy within the remains of the giant stone head. In matching green suits  they sit with the boy standing between them  who matures as they age in a series of fades.

He is continuously disturbed by the killing of his parents years back. He keeps remembering a man in a black raincoat on a white horse and with a tattoo on his right arm killing his parents on Vijay's birthday for filing a case. Vijay was brought up by his uncle and was always absent on his birthdays. He is in charge of a case where the district collector has been murdered and burned to death. The key eye witness Mala (Priyanka Chopra) has seen the murder by Teja's (Prakash Raj) Gang and refuses to co-operate. Teja is the head of an oil mafia operation and doesn't want Mala alive. Vijay manages to convince Mala to give a statement which makes her perpetrators come after her. He gives her shelter in his house to protect her and she starts to like him while Vijay does not reciprocate the same. This includes her giving him a potato and egg for lunch at his office and then annoying him by celebrating his birthday. He shouts at her and she begins to cry. Vijay tells her that he did not want to celebrate because his parents were killed on the very day and reveals his past to her. He finally reciprocates her love as he realised that Mala is slowly becoming an important part of his life. He also encounters Sher Khan (Sanjay Dutt/Srihari) who is into buying and selling of illegal cars.

In the middle of this  Vijay also finds about a man Prashant Khanna  who was killed years back by Teja. Due to certain incidents which gave Vijay wrong informations about the oil mafia Teja is handling  Vijay is suspended till the investigation is done with. Now Vijay warns Teja that there are no seniors or rules that bind him and now Vijay will finish Teja in his own style. Slowly  Vijay begins to destroy almost all of Teja's oil refineries. But Mala says that all these activities that Vijay is doing can have dangerous consequences. One night  Vijay and Mala go to a restaurant for dinner where Vijay gets attacked by two of Teja's men in the bathroom. Vijay kills both the men and calls Teja and warns him that even if he sends the rest of his 198 men (it was earlier mentioned by Teja that he has 200 workers under him)  nothing will happen to Vijay. A few days later  Sher Khan invites Vijay and Mala to a party. Later on  when they are returning home  they are attacked once again by ten of Teja's men. Vijay manages to lock Mala in a small room there and gets badly injured fighting them. He is almost killed but just in time  Sher Khan comes there  handles the rest of the goons and along with Mala  takes Vijay to the hospital. The next day  Teja comes there and criticizes Vijay saying that he is one who can only talk and doesn't have the guts to face Teja. After he leaves  Mala finally tells Vijay to finish Teja once and for all. That night Teja's men along with Bosco (Ankur Bhatia) kill Jaydev and the whole city begins to panic. Meanwhile  two sub inspectors who work under Vijay gives Sher Khan information that the night Kataria was murdered  an inspector  Saalwe had arrested a man for a petty case. But Saalwe did not record the case and so they suspect Saalwe and the man who he arrested had killed Kataria. So  using some of his informers Sher Khan finds Saalwe and Teja's trusted man Bosco (Ankur Bhatia) who was hiding himself and Saalwe in a colony. Then he puts them in front of the commissioner and they agree that they had killed Kataria by breaking his neck and they had done it on Teja's saying as he feared Kataria might leak all the information about his gang. The commissioner realizes Vijay's Innocence and claims Teja a wanted criminal. Out of fear  Teja runs away into an old mine with Mona (Mahie Gill)  but Vijay manages to track him down. Teja manages to get Vijay at gun point and pulls his coat's sleeve back. Then Vijay notices a tattoo on Teja's arm and realizes that he is the very one who killed his parents. Then Vijay says that Prashant Khanna who Teja killed years back was Vijay's dad. Teja is shocked and reveals that Prashant had filed a case against him and so Teja had to kill Prashant. In a fit of rage  Vijay begins to beat Teja badly. Vijay then breaks Teja's arm and kicks him into a bundle of petroleum barrels and shoots the barrels  causing Teja to die in the blast. The government announces all the wealth to be given to Mona  who was also said to be in all of Teja's nefarious activities.

The Indian army assigns this matter to Colonel Ranvir Singh Ranawat (Ajay Devgn)  who along with his men  apprehends and arrests the ring-leader Baba Zaheer Khan (Mukesh Tiwari). The Colonel takes one of his subordinates  Jaydev Malhotra (Abhishek Bachchan) to task  as nine soldiers were killed due to his negligence and asks him to resign. An Islamic terrorist group  Al-Tahir  recruits a group of men to try to evacuate their leader Baba Zaheer from Army prison  albeit in vain as their plans are thwarted by Jaydev  who is now an Assistant Commissioner of Police in the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) in Mumbai city. ACP Jaydev summons a usual suspect named Fareed (Sanjay Mishra)  who is a Garage owner for the vehicles recovered from the terrorists  being sold from his garage. Fareed is contracted by a college Professor to provide shelter  food  arms and other necessities to the new recruits of Al-Tahir militant group whose sole mission is to hijack a civilian plane  take it to Pakistan-administered Kashmir  and then negotiate a deal with the Indian Government to release their leader Baba Zaheer in lieu of the lives of all 107 on-board passengers. This group of militants discover that Fareed's cover has been blown and Mumbai ATS is keeping an eye on Fareed  which could compromise their mission. Hence  the leader of their group murders Fareed in the presence of the Professor  and throws his dead-body into the sea. The Professor bribes two corrupt officials of the Mumbai Airport to sneak in Guns inside the flight as they never go through the security checks. In a cross-fire between Mumbai ATS  ACP Jaydev Malhotra and Col. Ranveer Singh  one of the militants' gets killed but the rest manage to make it to the airport and board the flight.

Jaydev apprehends him to which he confesses of sneaking in guns and other ammunition into the flight.

The Army and the Indian police collaborate and both Ranvir and Jaydev are asked to work together. Ranvir is weary of Jaydev's capabilities  since Jaydev is investigating Ranvir and his men who are suspected of supplying arms and ammunitions to terrorists and Pakistanis. The duo nevertheless work out a plan to free the hostages and apprehend the terrorists. What they do not know is that their plan has already been compromised  and they may well be headed to their respective deaths.

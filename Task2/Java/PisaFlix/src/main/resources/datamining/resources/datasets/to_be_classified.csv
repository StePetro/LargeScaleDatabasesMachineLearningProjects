As a result of this Ganga dresses up with horn rimmed eye glasses and buck teeth  sending Arjun into a panic about the success of Kishorilal's plans. Later he gets a chance to meet the authentic Ganga  he is entranced.In an effort to make up for his offensive behaviour Arjun promises to be a trustworthy friend and asks her how he should make amends. Immediately  Ganga requests he return the farm animals and the servants back into the house. She explains to Arjun that in her family  they love all who are a part of it  even animals and servants. This is in direct contrast to Arjun's western view that they are not very important.When Rajiv arrives  he also acts offensively; sometimes intentionally  and sometimes because he has no idea of what Indians consider rude or inappropriate. Arjun  despite his own attraction to Ganga  smooths the way for Rajiv to bond with Ganga  as per Kishorilal's wishes. In his determination to make Rajiv's marriage happen with Ganga Arjun deceives Ganga about Rajiv's character and habits; he assures her that Rajiv is a nice guy he also covers up for Rajiv  telling Ganga the cigarettes she found in Rajiv's room are his own.Rajiv and Ganga both agree to marry each other thanks to Arjun's efforts. The engagement is set in India  but the families agree that Ganga should visit America before her wedding day. Soon after her engagement  Ganga arrives in USA but her feelings are hurt as her traditional dress is despised by Rajiv's snarky mother. After a few weeks in the USA  Ganga is home-sick. Her only true friend is Arjun with whom she begins to form a special bond. One day  she is invited to attend a very large and influential gathering arranged by Kishorilal and is also invited to sing. She sings the same I Love My India and receives warm  sincere applause.Gradually Ganga realises that Rajiv isn't the person Arjun had portrayed him to be when they were in India. Rajiv not only seems eager to leave her at home whenever possible  with little explanation or apology. When he does bring her out with his friends  he smokes  gets drunk and acts like a bully. At one party  he is drinking and flirting with other women while another man begins dancing too closely with Ganga. Rajiv ignores the situation  Arjun loses his temper and fights the man to the ground. Later  Ganga is shocked to discover pictures of Rajiv with his girlfriend that clearly show he has had a sexual relationship with her. She is also astonished to find that Kishorilal's family treats Arjun  a trusted member as a servant.When Rajiv abandons Ganga for dinner with his girlfriend  Ganga confronts Arjun and demands an explanation. Arjun justifies Rajiv's behaviour  reminding Ganga that Rajiv lives like an American  and that she should not make a fuss about such a petty affair. This exchange leads to a key monologue from Ganga. Infuriated that Arjun sees Rajiv's casual  unapologetic unfaithfulness as a petty affair  she tells him that she needs Love  the kind of love he (Arjun) gives others. She further rejects being made into a decoration to fit into Kishorilal's palatial mansion. At this point  Arjun realises that he has fallen in love with Ganga  but because of his immense loyalty to Kishorilal  he continues to encourage her to continue with the engagement and worry about changing Rajiv later.The next day  it is Arjun's birthday and he is depressed  a thoughtful Ganga senses his frustration and asks Rajiv to accompany her to wish Arjun a happy birthday. Rajiv refuses  making it clear that he views Arjun as some kind of servant. Hence  Ganga visits the garage without Rajiv  throwing a surprise party to liven up Arjun's spirits. Rajiv's hostile aunt Neeta notices the growing friendship between Ganga and Arjun and warns Kishorilal. He arranges for Arjun to relocate urgently telling him he has been promoted  and must start with attending a board meeting the following morning in another city far away. Kishorilal then plans a short outing vacation for Rajiv to be with Ganga in Las Vegas.In Las Vegas  Rajiv gets drunk and reveals his contempt for his fellow Indians; he derides Indians as hypocrites and stupid. Ganga heatedly responds that Indians hate America's drug-riddled  amoral alternative and slaps Rajiv. Furious  he tries to rape Ganga; after a violent struggle  she knocks him unconscious and flees.Rajiv informs Kishorilal who quickly starts looking for the missing Ganga. Arjun finds her crying at a train station with her clothes torn. He tries to persuade her to go back to Kishorilal's home  but she refuses. Arjun promises to protect her and help her get back to her family safely in India. After Arjun and Ganga safely arrive in India  Kishorilal informs Suraj that Arjun eloped with Ganga and Suraj quickly picks up a family sword that hangs on the wall. Arjun seizes that sword and swears to Ganga's faithfulness and chastity. Then Arjun leaves  intending never to return. Meanwhile  Ganga is not allowed to say a word  and is locked inside a horse shed. Ganga's younger siblings and grandmother sneak in and advise her to run away with Arjun. It is now that Ganga realises that she is in love with Arjun  and with their help  secretly leaves home. By this time  Kishorilal has arrived in India with Rajiv.Ganga catches up with Arjun at a temple  and demands that he express his love but Arjun is still loyal to Kishorilal and refuses to marry her.nGanga is devastated but before Arjun walks away  Rajiv turns up with several thugs to kill Arjun but Ganga protects Arjun using her body as a shield.In the ensuing fight  Arjun takes a terrible beating before getting the upper hand. Kishorilal arrives with Suraj just as Arjun is about to kill Rajiv. Kishorilal furiously suggests that Arjun honorably kill himself with a conveniently handy gun  and demands Arjun tell the truth about how he came to be in India with Rajiv's promised bride.This leads to the second key monologue of the film.Arjun confronts Kishorilal with not wanting to know the truth; people who want the truth  don't ask for it with a gun. He accuses Kishorilal of having become a true Westerner after all  since his wealth has eviscerated his compassion and ability to examine the truth when it doesn't match what he wants it to be. Confessing that he does  in truth  love Ganga  he affirms that he never pursued her and has acted honourably  while Rajiv in every way rejected honourable action and lied about how Ganga came to have returned so suddenly to India; not only was Ganga (personification of the most valued aspects of Indian culture)  unable to merge with Western culture  Western values (in the person of Rajiv) almost utterly ruined Ganga.Ganga confirms Rajiv's attempted rape  which shocks everyone  then tells her father she is willing to die by whatever means he chooses; poison  fire  or hunger. This pivotal scene both verbalises and symbolises how good  happy  pure Ganga (Indian values)  instead of being able to uplift and enrich Rajiv (Western values)  has been sacrificed to the unsuccessful attempt to merge India with the West.Ironically  it also highlights one way in which Western culture can be viewed as more just and compassionate than Indian culture  since a Western bride can break off an unsuitable engagement without risking death at the hands of outraged family members.Moreover  but realising he has indeed heard the truth  Kishorilal affirms that Ganga will marry his son. Rejecting Rajiv (and  symbolically  his own Western compromises)  he embraces Arjun as his true son  and along with Suraj and his family blesses the upcoming marriage between Arjun and Ganga."

One night  strange worm-like creatures with drills as a 'head' called Parasytes appear on Earth  taking over the brains of human hosts by entering through their ears or noses. One Parasite attempts to crawl into Shinichi's nose while he sleeps  but fails as Shinichi wakes up  and enters his body by burrowing into his arm instead. In the Japanese version  it takes over his right hand and is named Migi ()  after the Japanese word for 'right'; Tokyopop's 1990s English version  in which the images are flipped horizontally  has the Parasite take over Shinichi's left hand and it is named Lefty.Because Shinichi was able to prevent Migi from travelling further up into his brain  both beings retain their separate intellect and personality. As the duo encounter other Parasites  they capitalize on their strange situation and gradually form a strong bond  working together to survive. This gives them an edge in battling other Parasites who frequently attack the pair upon realization that Shinichi's human brain is still intact.

Alvin  a school bully  arrives and prevents Norman from reading the story before sundown. Norman attempts to continue reading from the book  to no effect. A ghostly storm resembling the witch appears in the air  summoning the cursed dead to arise as zombies  who chase the boys along with Norman's 17-year-old sister  Courtney; and Neil's older brother Mitch  down the hill and into town. Having realized that the witch was not buried in the graveyard  Norman contacts classmate Salma (who tells them to access the Town Hall's archives for the location of the witch's unmarked grave) for help. As the kids make their way to the Town Hall  the zombies are attacked by the citizenry. During the riot  Norman and his companions break into the archives but cannot find the information they need. As the mob moves to attack Town Hall  the witch storm appears over the crowd. Norman climbs the Hall's tower to read the book  in a last-ditch effort to finish the ritual  but the witch strikes the book with lightning  hurling Norman from the tower and deep into the archives.Unconscious  Norman has a dream where he learns that the witch was Agatha Prenderghast  a little girl of his age who was also a medium. Norman realizes that Agatha was wrongfully convicted by the town council when they mistook her powers for witchcraft. After awakening  Norman encounters the zombies and recognizes them as the town council who convicted Agatha. The zombies admit that they only wanted to speak with him to ensure that he would take up the ritual  to minimize the damage of the mistake they made so long ago. Norman attempts to help the zombies slip away so they can guide him to Agatha's grave  but is cornered by the mob. Courtney  Mitch  Neil  and Alvin rally to Norman's side and confront the crowd  arguing that their rage  fear  and misunderstanding make them no different than the cursed townsfolk from long ago. Although the mob calms down  the witch unleashes her powers to create greater havoc throughout the town.Judge Hopkins guides Norman's family to the grave in a forest. Before the grave is reached  Agatha's magical powers separate Norman from the others. Norman finds the grave and interacts with Agatha's vengeful spirit  determined to stop the cataclysmic tantrum she has been having over the years. Though she attempts to push him away Norman holds his ground  telling her that he understands how she feels as an outcast  that her vengeance has only made her like the ones who wronged her  and eventually forcing her to remember happier days. Having finally encountered someone who understands her plight  Agatha is able to find a measure of peace and cross over to the afterlife. The storm dissipates  and she and the zombies all fade away. The town cleans up and regards Norman as a hero. In the end  Norman watches a horror film with the ghost of his grandmother and his family  who have grown to accept Norman for who he is."
